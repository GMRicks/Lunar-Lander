# Lunar-Lander
Deep Q-Learning for Lunar Lander: A reinforcement learning project using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to land a spacecraft safely between two poles at a specific coordinate in the LunarLander-v2 environment. The agent employs experience replay, epsilon-greedy exploration, and soft target updates to achieve precise and safe landings.
